- Back up your project (backup yesterday, today, tomorrow and always);
- Run the file (PHP or PY, it's up to you) from the folder you want to run the check (the process occurs recursively in all JS);

- Use only if you know what you are doing;
- There are no guarantees, do it in test environments first;
- As it is just a complement that uses other scanning and cleaning tools, adapt it to your malware model if necessary;
- Use alternative tools if you have them, this one is just a complement.
